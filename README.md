### Hi there!

I'm building:

- [Blueboat](https://github.com/losfair/blueboat), an open-source serverless runtime, and
- [Planet](https://planet.ink), a note-taking app for writing and sharing networked thoughts (that runs on Blueboat!)
- [MagiCore](https://github.com/losfair/MagiCore), an out-of-order processor that supports multiple instruction sets.
